# Noah Baron CMPM 121 D1 Project

An incremental clicking game, based off of Universal Paperclips and Cookie Clicker. In this game, you click snowmen to generate a snowman army.

Inspiration:

InvinciblePyro. This dev inspired me to have my buttons hidden from the start, and as the player generates more snowmen they start to appear. This gives the player a sense of unease, and makes them unsure of all of the content that is in the game from the start.
